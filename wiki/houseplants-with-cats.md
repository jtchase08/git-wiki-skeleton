## Houseplants with Cats

### Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)

* Features: Spider plants have long, arching leaves with a green and white striped pattern.
* Care: They thrive in bright, indirect light but can tolerate some shade. Allow the soil to dry slightly between waterings. They produce "pups" or baby plants on long stems, which can be propagated easily.
* Cat-Friendly: The leaves aren't appealing to cats, making it less likely that they'll nibble on them.

### Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata)

* Features: Boston ferns have feathery fronds that create a lush and airy appearance.
- Care: They prefer indirect light and high humidity. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Regular misting can help maintain humidity levels.
- Cat-Friendly: Boston ferns are non-toxic to cats, making them a safe choice.
  
### Areca Palm (Dypsis lutescens)

* Features: Areca palms have feathery fronds that give a tropical look. They can grow quite tall over time.
- Care: Place in bright, indirect light. Water when the top inch of soil is dry. They are sensitive to overwatering, so be cautious not to let the roots sit in water.
- Cat-Friendly: Areca palms pose no harm to cats and provide a touch of exotic greenery.
  
### Calathea (Calathea spp.)

* Features: Calatheas are known for their vibrant, patterned leaves that come in various colors and designs.
* Care: Keep them in indirect light and ensure the soil stays consistently moist but not soggy. They benefit from higher humidity levels.
* Cat-Friendly: Calatheas are generally non-toxic to cats, and their striking foliage can add a lively touch to your space.
  
### Parlor Palm (Chamaedorea elegans)

* Features: Parlor palms have delicate, feather-like fronds that give a classic look.
* Care: They thrive in low to medium light and prefer slightly damp soil. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out before watering again.
* Cat-Friendly: Parlor palms are safe for cats, and their compact size makes them suitable for various spaces.
  
### Peperomia (Peperomia spp.)

* Features: Peperomias come in various leaf shapes, colors, and textures, making them visually appealing.

These plants offer a variety of appearances and care requirements, allowing you to choose the ones that best suit your preferences and space. Keep in mind that even though these plants are considered safe for cats, it's a good idea to monitor your pets' behavior around them to ensure they don't develop a taste for the leaves.
