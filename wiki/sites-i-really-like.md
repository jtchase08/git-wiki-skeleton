## Sites I really like

### Learn X in Y Minutes

Have you ever been coding in a language you're not super familiar with, and forget the syntax for something simple? You turn to google to find the answer, but you wish you had a **cheatsheet** of sorts for the language you're coding in? Enter Learn X in Y Minutes.

Learn X in Y Minutes is a collection of cheatsheets and quick reference guides for most programming languages you'll encounter these days.

### Stats for Spotify

So Spotify does this cool thing where they give you "your year wrapped" near the end of the calendar year. It gives you some cool highlights and stats about what you listened to for the previous year.

But I want stats all year round. So I use Stats for Spotify. It links to your Spotify account and will list things like your Top Tracks, Top Artists, and Top Genres over various periods of time, with a history for each artist and song.

### Syncthing

Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. It's basically a self-hosted cloud solution a la Google Drive or Dropbox. It's easy to set up, and supports most platforms such as Windows, MacOS, and Android. I'm using it to backup this very website.

### Budget Bytes

They believe good food doesnâ€™t have to be complicated or expensive. They believe you can do this without spending your whole paycheck, buying a bunch of fancy kitchenware, or spending all day in the kitchen. They believe you can spend less and enjoy more.

My favorite recipe website. Breaks recipes down by cost per ingredient.
