**Step 1: Preparing the Surface**

- Clean the 3D print with isopropyl alcohol or mild soap and water to remove any dirt or oils.
- Gently sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper. Aim for a slightly rough texture without over-sanding.

**Step 2: Applying Primer**

- Choose a plastic-specific primer compatible with PLA.
- Shake the primer well before use.
- Apply a thin, even coat of primer to the 3D print. Allow it to dry as per the manufacturer's instructions.

**Step 3: Painting**

- Select your desired acrylic paint colors for the project.
- Begin with a base coat of the lightest color. Apply thin coats, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next.
- Use paintbrushes to add details and additional colors. Acrylic paints are versatile and can be layered effectively.
- Be patient and apply multiple thin coats for a smooth, even finish.

**Step 4: Drying**

- After the final layer of paint is applied, let the paint thoroughly dry. This may take a few hours or as indicated by the paint manufacturer.

**Step 5: Sealing**

- Once the paint is dry, consider applying a clear sealant or varnish to protect the paint and give it a polished appearance.
- Apply the sealant in a well-ventilated area according to the product instructions. Usually, a few thin coats work best.

**Step 6: Final Touches**

- Inspect your painted 3D print for any imperfections or touch-ups needed.
- Make any necessary corrections with additional paint or detail work.

**Step 7: Enjoy Your Finished Project**

- Once the sealant is dry, your painted PLA 3D print is ready to be displayed or used in your project.
- Admire your creative work and the transformation of the 3D print!

Remember, practice and patience go a long way in achieving the best results. Feel free to experiment with techniques and colors to make your project uniquely yours.
